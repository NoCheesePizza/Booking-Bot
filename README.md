# Telegram Bot
A bot to make my and my friends' lives a teeny bit more convenient
## Features
### *Book Discussion Rooms*
This is the only feature that has been added as of now. The other two below have already been developed and tested but they have yet to be integrated into this catch-all Telegram bot. 

The core feature of this bot is its ability to book discussion rooms in SIT@SP, thus forgoing users the need to thrawl through SIT's cumbersome mobile website. It can pick the highest priority room that is available, and can even show users the available timeslots for each of the rooms. What's more, users can easily view and cancel their bookings at any point in time through Telegram.

### *Give Homework Report*
This bot can log into my Moodle account and fetch all upcoming submissions from the calendar page. Then, it can format the data nicely by grouping submissions on the same date together and send the result on Telegram for everyone in the group chat to see (and panic).
